# GoJS Course
Following course consists of multiple lessons that aim to teach you solutions when it comes to developing interactive diagrams using GoJS library.  
Throughout this course we'll be building interactive diagram that will allow visualize a family tree.  
Each lesson will cover a part or functionality that is being provided by the GoJS library.  
At the end of each lesson there will be a homework.  
It's purpose is to help you memorize the subject that was covered in particular lesson.  
Moreover, things that were supposed be done within the homework, will be required to progress in course.  
Otherwise the application will be incomplete.  

## Target audience
This course is dedicated both, to beginner and experienced programmers. 

## Prerequisites
Minimal knowledge:  

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* code editor of your choice

Optimal knowledge:  

* all previous
* TypeScript
* OOP
* React/Angular

## What you'll learn
The goal of this course is to teach you skills required to create, develop and maintain  
interactive diagrams using GoJS library.  
As the course progresses, you'll learn more and more capabilities of GoJS library.  
Since we use TypeScript within our projects, we're going to use it within this course as well.  
Don't worry if you've never programmed in TypeScript, it's like JavaScript but with some useful additions.  
Some techniques that we'll use within this course could be useful in other aspects of frontend programming.  

## Introduction
GoJS is a diagramming library which allows [*Rapidly Building Interactive Diagrams*](https://gojs.net/latest/index.html).  
It offers features such as:  

* drag'n'drop
* copy & paste
* in-place text editing
* tooltips
* context menus
* layouting
* templates
* bidirectional data binding
* transactional state
* undo manager
* extensible tools
* and more

It's worth to mention, that this library comes with TypeScript support for improved developing experience.
